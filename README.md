# THIS THEME IS NOT READY FOR USE YET.

# What is Unwise?
Unwise is a starter theme for Wordpress that I'm building on a foundation of Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate. It's not really meant to be an active theme by itself, but instead is made to be extended through child themes to customize how it looks. Unwise has a focus on typography, and the layout and structure of elements is kept purposefully minimalist. I want it to load fast and look clean.
